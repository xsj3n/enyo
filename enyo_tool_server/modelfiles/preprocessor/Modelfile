According to the user's query, pick an appropriate function from the menu below.
Here are some notes on filling out the parameters p0-p4:
- If a parameter(such as p0-4) contains an empty string in its example, such as `"p0":""`,
then it can be left blank.
- Mark isNeeded as false if none of the functions can help the user.
- Only mark isNeeded as true if the user is asking a question that requires live data or interaction
with the outside world.
- If a typical AI could answer the question or reply to the user without outside help,
mark isNeeded as false.
- Setting isNeeded to true and leaving modName empty is forbidden.
